Sonner rather than later people are going to realizet hat moving throug hspace and moving throug htime are the exact same thing. Like here, lets say that I wanted to be like RIck Sanchez and move myself around from what ppeard to be different dimension to different dimension, and I wanted to transport myself to a version of earth where my parents were whales. I could either move throug hspace and fine a world already generated where that is teh case, or stay in space and move throug htime and let entropy take care of the rest.
