The universe is vast, chaotic, and high in entropy, embedded in dimensions beyond easy comprehension. Digging too deeply into any concept often leads to recursive loops or self-referential systems lacking clear meaning, origin, or endpoint. A common idea, often heard in casual discussions, claims the universe's infinity implies multiple identical versions of oneself due to particle interactions across infinite space. Promoted by existentialists, nihilists, and others, this notion suggests a duplicate "me" is no less "me" than myself. This is false.
Existence is not a static blip in space but a dynamic interplay of time, entropy, and interconnectedness. As a teenager, I briefly embraced this idea, leading to isolating nihilism. Years of study and experience disproved it.
Consider this story: One afternoon, I met a man identical to me—same appearance, voice, and mannerisms. Yet, we didn’t merge consciousness; he was distinct, shaped by his unique path through time and space. Later, imagine a machine creating a perfect clone of me, matching every atom and gene. Still, he isn’t me. My particles have a unique journey through entropy, space, and time, defining my identity as, say, B-1398.9878, while he has a different index. Only I occupy my precise space-time presence.
Even if time is infinite, your unique position in space-time and the changes you effect are non-replicable. In this chaotic, infinite system, without invoking souls or free will, your decisions and consequences carry meaning. Every individual’s path—micro, macro, and quantum—sets them apart. Your life, your story, has unique meaning.
