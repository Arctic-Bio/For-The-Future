    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction to Chrono-Loop Mathematics</h2>
        <p>Chrono-Loop Mathematics (CLM) is a revolutionary system where mathematical expressions are inherently tied to time. Unlike traditional math, where results like 2 + 3 = 5 hold regardless of when they're computed, CLM expressions require time to have meaning. They rely on self-referential temporal loops, inspired by concepts like Heraclitus' flux, temporal logic, and dynamical systems. In CLM, values, operations, and proofs are functions of time, called <em>chrono-variables</em>, and their consistency depends on resolving these loops, much like a system pulling itself into existence through a "temporal bootstrap."</p>
        <p>Without time, CLM collapses—nothing is valuable without an index of time, but with time, every expression becomes uniquely meaningful, reflecting the universe's dynamic nature.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="simulations">
        <h2>CLM in Simulations</h2>
        <p>In simulations, CLM models dynamic systems where time is essential. For example, a chrono-variable <code>x(t)</code> might represent a system's state (e.g., a pendulum's angle) that depends on its past and future states. The <em>Bootstrap Addition</em> operation, <code>z(t) ⊕_τ w(t)</code>, defines a result <code>u(t) = z(t) + w(t + τ) - u(t - τ)</code>, creating a feedback loop that stabilizes over time. This mirrors real-world simulations like weather forecasting, where predictions adjust based on past and future data.</p>
        <p>Below is a simple simulation of a CLM loop, showing a chrono-variable oscillating due to temporal feedback (e.g., <code>u(t) = sin(t) + u(t - 1)</code> simplified). Click "Run Simulation" to see it evolve.</p>

    <section id="encryption">
        <h2>CLM in Encryption</h2>
        <p>CLM's time-dependent loops are ideal for encryption, where keys evolve dynamically. The <em>Temporal Convolution Product</em>, <code>z(t) ⊗_τ w(t)</code>, creates a key <code>u(t)</code> that depends on integrating past and future states, making it unpredictable without the exact temporal context. For instance, a key might be generated as <code>u(t) = ∫ z(s) u(t - s) ds + w(t)</code>, where the loop ensures only synchronized systems can decrypt. This resembles quantum cryptography, where time-based correlations secure communication.</p>
        <p>CLM encryption ensures that without the correct time index, the key is meaningless, enhancing security through temporal uniqueness.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="living-systems">
        <h2>CLM in Living Systems</h2>
        <p>Living systems, like cells or ecosystems, are inherently time-dependent, with feedback loops driving growth and adaptation. CLM's <em>Future-Past Negation</em>, <code>¬_τ y(t)</code>, models processes like gene regulation, where a state (e.g., protein concentration) flips based on future and past conditions: <code>v(t) = -y(t) + v(t + τ) * v(t - τ)</code>. This creates oscillatory patterns, like circadian rhythms, where time ensures stability.</p>
        <p>CLM shows that life requires time's arrow—without it, biological processes lose coherence, but with it, each cycle is uniquely special, reflecting the universe's bootstrapped complexity.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="time-dependency">
        <h2>Why Time Matters</h2>
        <p>In CLM, nothing is valuable without time. Static math yields paradoxes (e.g., <code>x = x + 1</code> is insoluble), but CLM resolves such loops through temporal iteration, like a system finding its own equilibrium. This mirrors the universe's origin, where time enables self-consistent "bootstrapping" of existence, as seen in physics' closed timelike curves or chaotic attractors. With time, every chrono-variable, operation, or system becomes uniquely meaningful, embodying the dynamic essence of reality.</p>
