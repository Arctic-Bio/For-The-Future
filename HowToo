The difference between AI and AGI is this.
AI attempts to create a grid to maximize the output. AGI attempts to make a grid to learn the rules to maximize the output of any realm in a general way.
One can use algebra to create a function to find the fastest way to connect two points, and you can train an AI to respond with that, or just make a simulation or use an algorithm. An AGI, instead, creates a concept map of what its goals are and then functions off of not receiving goals and working off of thatâ€”but perceiving goals and objectives and solving based on those.
AGI systems don't work to maximize scores, but instead function to maximize scores based on any scenario, meaning they are needed to learn the rules of a situation, not the singular system. And we cannot do that through just doing it over a million times; that's a solution average. You must do it once and have enough to solve it the second time.
Generalized intelligence lies in the ability to come up with a goal position, a metric to track, and a revision process all on your own. That is meta-intelligence.
